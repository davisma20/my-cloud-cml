# Next Steps: Resolving CML Networking Issues with Packer

*Last Updated: March 23, 2025*

## Root Cause Analysis

The CML instance networking issues (manifested as "Instance reachability check failed") likely stem from one or more of these fundamental problems:

1. **Cloud-init Script Errors**: The system logs revealed syntax errors in user data scripts:
   ```
   /var/lib/cloud/instance/scripts/runcmd: 4: Syntax error: redirection unexpected
   Failed to run module scripts_user (scripts in /var/lib/cloud/instance/scripts)
   ```
   These errors prevent proper instance initialization, including network configuration.

2. **Package Installation Failures**: The logs showed package installation issues:
   ```
   cc_package_update_upgrade_install.py[WARNING]: 2 failed with exceptions
   ```
   Critical networking packages may have failed to install or configure properly.

3. **Configuration Race Conditions**: Some services may be starting before their dependencies are fully initialized, particularly in a cloud environment where network interfaces might not be immediately available.

4. **Virtualization Compatibility Issues**: The CML workload has specific virtualization requirements that may not be fully compatible with the default AWS instance configuration.

## Packer-Based Solution Strategy

Using HashiCorp Packer to build a custom AMI provides several advantages for resolving these issues:

1. **Controlled Build Environment**: Packer builds happen in a controlled environment where you can observe and debug each step.

2. **Pre-baked Configuration**: Critical configurations are baked into the AMI rather than relying on cloud-init scripts at runtime.

3. **Pre-installed Dependencies**: All required packages and drivers are installed during AMI creation.

4. **Network Validation**: Network connectivity can be verified during the build process.

## Methodical Approach to Building and Testing a CML AMI with Packer

### 1. Prepare Packer Configuration

1. **Examine existing Packer templates**:
   ```bash
   cd /Users/miked/Documents/Projects/python_project/my-cloud-cml/packer
   cat cml-simple.pkr.hcl
   ```

2. **Create an enhanced Packer template** with explicit network validation steps:

   ```hcl
   # cml-network-validated.pkr.hcl
   source "amazon-ebs" "cml" {
     ami_name        = "cml-network-validated-${formatdate("YYYYMMDD-hhmm", timestamp())}"
     instance_type   = "c5.2xlarge"
     region          = "us-east-2"
     source_ami_filter {
       filters = {
         name                = "ubuntu/images/hvm-ssd/ubuntu-focal-20.04-amd64-server-*"
         root-device-type    = "ebs"
         virtualization-type = "hvm"
       }
       most_recent = true
       owners      = ["099720109477"] # Canonical
     }
     ssh_username     = "ubuntu"
     ssh_agent_auth   = false
     ssh_timeout      = "10m"
     
     # Network validation settings
     associate_public_ip_address = true
     temporary_security_group_source_cidrs = ["0.0.0.0/0"]

     # EBS root volume configuration
     launch_block_device_mappings {
       device_name           = "/dev/sda1"
       volume_size           = 64
       volume_type           = "gp3"
       delete_on_termination = true
     }
     
     # IMDSv2 requirement for security

   ```

### 2. Create Supporting Scripts

1. **CML Prerequisites Installation Script**:

   ```bash
   # scripts/install_cml_prereqs.sh
   #!/bin/bash
   set -e
   
   echo "Installing CML prerequisites..."
   
   # Update repositories
   apt-get update
   
   # Install essential packages
   DEBIAN_FRONTEND=noninteractive apt-get install -y \
     apt-transport-https \
     ca-certificates \
     curl \
     gnupg \
     lsb-release \
     qemu-kvm \
     libvirt-daemon-system \
     libvirt-clients \
     bridge-utils \
     cpu-checker \
     cloud-init \
     cloud-guest-utils \
     jq \
     python3-pip \
     amazon-ssm-agent
   
   # Verify virtualization support
   if ! kvm-ok; then
     echo "WARNING: KVM virtualization may not be supported on this machine!"
   fi
   
   # Configure libvirt
   systemctl enable libvirtd
   systemctl start libvirtd
   
   # Configure SSM agent
   systemctl enable amazon-ssm-agent
   systemctl start amazon-ssm-agent
   
   # Verify network configuration
   echo "Testing network connectivity..."
   if ping -c 3 8.8.8.8 > /dev/null; then
     echo "Network connectivity test passed"
   else
     echo "Network connectivity test failed!"
     exit 1
   fi
   
   echo "CML prerequisites installation completed successfully"
   ```

2. **Security Hardening Script**:

   ```bash
   # scripts/security_hardening.sh
   #!/bin/bash
   set -e
   
   echo "Applying security hardening measures..."
   
   # Install security packages
   apt-get update
   DEBIAN_FRONTEND=noninteractive apt-get install -y \
     unattended-upgrades \
     apt-listchanges \
     ufw \
     fail2ban \
     libpam-pwquality
   
   # Configure automatic updates
   echo "Configuring automatic security updates..."
   cat > /etc/apt/apt.conf.d/20auto-upgrades << EOF
   APT::Periodic::Update-Package-Lists "1";
   APT::Periodic::Unattended-Upgrade "1";
   APT::Periodic::AutocleanInterval "7";
   EOF
   
   systemctl enable unattended-upgrades
   systemctl start unattended-upgrades
   
   # Configure firewall
   echo "Configuring UFW firewall..."
   ufw default deny incoming
   ufw default allow outgoing
   ufw allow 22/tcp
   ufw allow 80/tcp
   ufw allow 443/tcp
   ufw allow 1122/tcp
   ufw allow 9090/tcp
   ufw allow 2000:7999/tcp
   ufw allow 2000:7999/udp
   
   # Enable UFW but don't start it yet (can interrupt Packer SSH session)
   systemctl enable ufw
   
   # Configure fail2ban
   echo "Configuring fail2ban..."
   cat > /etc/fail2ban/jail.local << EOF
   [DEFAULT]
   bantime = 3600
   findtime = 600
   maxretry = 5
   
   [sshd]
   enabled = true
   
   [sshd-ddos]
   enabled = true
   EOF
   
   systemctl enable fail2ban
   
   # Configure password policies
   echo "Configuring password policies..."
   cat > /etc/security/pwquality.conf << EOF
   minlen = 12
   dcredit = -1
   ucredit = -1
   ocredit = -1
   lcredit = -1
   EOF
   
   # Secure SSH configuration
   echo "Securing SSH configuration..."
   cat > /etc/ssh/sshd_config.d/hardening.conf << EOF
   PermitRootLogin no
   PasswordAuthentication no
   MaxAuthTries 3
   EOF
   
   echo "Security hardening completed successfully"
   ```

### 3. Execute Packer Build

Run the Packer build process:

```bash
cd /Users/miked/Documents/Projects/python_project/my-cloud-cml/packer
packer build cml-network-validated.pkr.hcl
```

During the build process, pay close attention to:
- Network validation steps (ping and curl tests)
- KVM/virtualization support verification
- Cloud-init script syntax validation
- CML GUI accessibility validation

### 4. Update Terraform Configuration

After a successful Packer build, update the `config.yml` file to use the new AMI:

```yaml
aws:
  cml_ami: "ami-XXXXXXXXX"  # Replace with your new AMI ID
```

## Network Validation During and After Instance Launch

### Validation During Packer Build

During the Packer build process, we incorporate several network validation steps:

1. **Basic Connectivity**: 
   - Ping test to 8.8.8.8 
   - HTTP connectivity test with curl

2. **Network Configuration**:
   - Verify IP addressing (`ip addr show`)
   - Verify routing table (`route -n`)

3. **Service Connectivity**:
   - Verify AWS SSM agent connection
   - Verify package repository access

4. **GUI Validation**:
   - Test HTTP server functionality
   - Mock CML login page access
   - Comprehensive validation script for the real CML interface

### Post-Launch Validation

Once the instance is launched with Terraform, we need to validate the networking is properly configured:

1. **Cloud-init Network Testing Script**:
   The AMI includes a per-boot validation script that tests network connectivity on every startup and logs the results to `/var/log/network_validation.log`.

2. **SSM Status Checking**:
   We can verify if the instance is properly registered with SSM after launch:
   ```bash
   aws ssm describe-instance-information --region us-east-2 --output table
   ```

3. **Instance Status Checks**:
   AWS performs automated status checks on instances. We can monitor these:
   ```bash
   aws ec2 describe-instance-status --instance-id i-XXXXXXXXX --region us-east-2
   ```

4. **Web Interface Validation**:
   Once the instance is running, we can verify the CML GUI is accessible:
   ```bash
   # From your local machine or DevNet workstation
   curl -k -I https://<cml-instance-ip>/login
   
   # Or open in a web browser
   https://<cml-instance-ip>/login
   ```

## Troubleshooting Network Issues Post-Launch

If network issues persist after launching an instance from the Packer-built AMI:

1. **Check Console Output**:
   ```bash
   aws ec2 get-console-output --instance-id i-XXXXXXXXX --region us-east-2 --output text
   ```
   Look for any boot-time errors, especially related to network configuration.

2. **Check Cloud-init Logs**:
   Connect to the instance via SSM (if available) or after stopping/starting the instance, and check:
   ```bash
   cat /var/log/cloud-init.log
   cat /var/log/cloud-init-output.log
   ```

3. **Check Network Validation Logs**:
   ```bash
   cat /var/log/network_validation.log
   ```

4. **Verify Network Interface Configuration**:
   Ensure the primary network interface is correctly attached and configured:
   ```bash
   aws ec2 describe-network-interfaces --filters "Name=attachment.instance-id,Values=i-XXXXXXXXX" --region us-east-2
   ```

5. **Verify Security Group Rules**:
   Confirm all necessary ports are open:
   ```bash
   aws ec2 describe-security-groups --group-id sg-XXXXXXXXX --region us-east-2
   ```

6. **Check CML Service Status**:
   If you can access the instance via SSM:
   ```bash
   sudo systemctl status cml
   journalctl -u cml
   ```

## Why Packer Will Help

Packer addresses the identified issues in several ways:

1. **Explicit Syntax Validation**: The Packer build process can validate shell scripts, including the problematic cloud-init scripts, before they're included in the AMI.

2. **Controlled Package Installation**: All required packages are installed during the AMI build, eliminating dependency issues during instance launch.

3. **Network Validation**: Network connectivity is explicitly tested during the build process, ensuring the AMI supports proper networking.

4. **Virtualization Verification**: The Packer build verifies KVM support, which is critical for CML's functionality.

5. **Cloud-init Simplification**: With core dependencies pre-installed in the AMI, cloud-init scripts can be simplified, reducing the risk of syntax errors.

6. **GUI Validation**: By testing the web interface during the build process, we can ensure the CML GUI is properly configured and accessible.

## Next Actions

1. **Create Enhanced Packer Templates**: Develop the template and scripts outlined above.

2. **Build and Test the AMI**: Run the Packer build process and verify network validation.

3. **Update Terraform Configuration**: Configure Terraform to use the new AMI.

4. **Deploy and Monitor**: Deploy CML using the new AMI and monitor for connectivity issues.

5. **Document Results**: Update documentation with findings and best practices.
